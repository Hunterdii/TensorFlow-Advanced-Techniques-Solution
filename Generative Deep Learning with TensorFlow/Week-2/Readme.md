2. After initializing your AutoEncoder you are all set to train it. Which of the following pieces of code will you use ?

   - autoencoder.fit(X_train, Y_train, epochs=epochs)
   - **_autoencoder.fit(X_train, X_train, epochs=epochs)_**
   - autoencoder.fit(Y_train, X_train, epochs=epochs)
   - autoencoder.fit(Y_train, Y_train, epochs=epochs)

3. Consider the following code for a simple AutoEncoder, what is model_1 outputting ?

   - **_Displaying the internal representation of the input the model is learning to replicate._**
   - Displaying the classification layer of the model, mapping input to the output label.
   - Displaying the reconstruction of the original input which was fed to this architecture.
   - Displaying the label value which the model is trying to reconstruct.
